This presentation will narrowly focus on the key considerations, materials, and instructions to craft a purpose-built network hardware implant to effectively breach a network during Red Team Engagements.

Red Team Engagements are multifaceted and can be very sophisticated in their planning and execution. The goals of these engagements vary, but frequently they require breaching the physical perimeter of a target organization to gain an internal network foothold. This foothold can be attained using a variety of techniques facilitated by physical access; however, the most expedient method with the highest probability of success is undoubtedly implanting a remote-controlled computer into the target organization. This computer is left behind to enable remote connectivity into the target’s internal network for Red Team Operators.

Presenting the engagement results to the organization’s non-technical leadership is intensely effective due to the relatability of exploiting physical to digital vulnerabilities mapped to real-world impacts. The results of successful Red Team Engagements are universally a swift organizational change to improve cybersecurity focus and resourcing. It is for this reason that crafting an effective, purpose-built implant is a critical skill for any Red Team Operator.

There are no good COTS hardware implants available on the market, I have spent the last 3 years building, testing, and using my own custom devices in real-world assessments.

Time to share what I’ve learned!
